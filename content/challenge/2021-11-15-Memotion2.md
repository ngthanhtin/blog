In this post, I want to introduce a new topic which is took place at First Workshop on ​Multimodal Fact-Checking and Hate Speech Detection in AAAI 2022. And I got the 1st position on the leaderboard of this challenge. Link to the challenge: https://aiisc.ai/defactify/memotion_2.html

### 1. Abstract
In this post, I want to talk about Meme Analysis which is about explaining its Sentiment, Emotion and Intensity. <br/>
The growing ubiquity of Internet memes on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter further suggests that we can not ignore such multimodal content (vision and language) anymore. To the best of our knowledge, there is not much attention towards meme emotion, and sentiment analysis. <br/>
The task of Memotion analysis consists of three task (1) sentiment(positive, negative, neutral) classification, (2) emotion (sarcastic,funny,offensive, motivation) classification and (3) their corresponding intensity. <br/>

Here is some example of Meme Images, they contain two information simultaneously which is text and image: <br/>

### 2. Model
The models consist of 3 primary types which are Unimodal for Only Text, Unimodal for Only Image, Multimodal for Text and Image.<br/>
In the Multimodal, I also employed several fusion mechanism such as Concatenation, Multihop Attention, and Stacked Attention. <br/>
#### 2.1 Unimodal for Text

#### 2.2 Unimodal for Image

#### 2.3 Multimodal

### 3. Techniques
In this competition, I have used some techniques to improve the F1 scores of the model.

#### 3.1 Scence Text Detection

#### 3.2 Auto Augmentation 

#### 3.3 Canonical Correlation Analysis

#### 3.4 Loss function, Optimizer, etc
For the classification task, I use CrossEntropy typically, but I also tested on Training Signal Anealing CrossEntropy which is a loss function that helps mitigate the imbalance effect of the dataset. <br/>
In terms of Optimizer, I tried several ones such as Adam, SGD, AdamW, LookAHead, etc.

### 4. Result

### 5. Application
Analysis meme images can help social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter mitigate the false information that are disemminating widely.<br/>
Moreover, the technique in this post can be applied to other Vision Language problems.
