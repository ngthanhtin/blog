<p>Exploring the lessons learned from each stumbling block on my journey.</p>
<h2>Internship Interviews</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comcast Research Internship (2024):</strong> Not selected after the interview because the research project of the team was NLP-related one, but I didn't have much experience in that topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Job Applications</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Medical Research Engineer at Medical FPT (2023):</strong> Selected as a fulltime position but at that time, I was not sure if I should drop the PhD and come back to Vietnam for this job, so I decided to decline this opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI Residency at VinAI (2022):</strong> Not selected after the mathematics test, I found that I was not good at math to get a AI Research Residency position.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Long-term Friendship:</strong> Grew apart due to differing life paths. Learned that relationships evolve and that's okay.</li>
</ul>
