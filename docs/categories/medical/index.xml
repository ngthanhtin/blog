      <description>In this post, I want to share our proposed model in diagnosing Covid-19 prognosis. Link to the challenge: https://ai4covid-hackathon.it/
1. Abstract Automatic or semi-automatic techniques to distinguish patients that can be safely home-treated from those that are likely to require intensive care would allow for better planning and smarter allocation of available resources. To this end, the Covid CXR Hackathon aims at designing effective solutions based on machine learning and data science supporting the medical doctor to formulate a Covid-19 prognosis from early chest X-ray images and clinical data collected during triage.</description>
