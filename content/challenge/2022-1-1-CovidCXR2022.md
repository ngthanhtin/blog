In this post, I want to share our proposed model in diagnosing Covid-19 prognosis. Link to the challenge: https://ai4covid-hackathon.it/

### 1. Abstract
Automatic or semi-automatic techniques to distinguish patients that can be safely home-treated from those that are likely to require intensive care would allow for better planning and smarter allocation of available resources. To this end, the Covid CXR Hackathon aims at designing effective solutions based on machine learning and data science supporting the medical doctor to formulate a Covid-19 prognosis from early chest X-ray images and clinical data collected during triage.

Here is some example of Chest X-Ray images, and some of the metadata:<br/>

### 2. Model
The models consist of 2 primary types which are Unimodal for Only Image, Multimodal for Metadata and Image.<br/>
In this post, we will go through each model in detail.

#### 2.1 Unimodal (only image)



#### 2.2 Multimodal (image and metadata)

### 3. Techniques
In this competition, the challengers use balance accuracy to evaluate the performance of a model.


#### 3.4 Loss function, Optimizer, etc
For the classification task, I use CrossEntropy typically, but I also tested on Training Signal Anealing CrossEntropy which is a loss function that helps mitigate the imbalance effect of the dataset. <br/>
In terms of Optimizer, I tried several ones such as Adam, SGD, AdamW, LookAHead, etc.

### 4. Result

### 5. Application
Analysis meme images can help social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter mitigate the false information that are disemminating widely.<br/>
Moreover, the technique in this post can be applied to other Vision Language problems.
