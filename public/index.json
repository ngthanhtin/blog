And I got the 1st position on the leaderboard of this challenge. Link to the challenge: https://aiisc.ai/defactify/memotion_2.html\n1. Abstract In this post, I want to talk about Meme Analysis which is about explaining its Sentiment, Emotion and Intensity.  The growing ubiquity of Internet memes on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter further suggests that we can not ignore such multimodal content (vision and language) anymore. To the best of our knowledge, there is not much attention towards meme emotion, and sentiment analysis.  The task of Memotion analysis consists of three task (1) sentiment(positive, negative, neutral) classification, (2) emotion (sarcastic,funny,offensive, motivation) classification and (3) their corresponding intensity. \nHere is some example of Meme Images, they contain two information simultaneously which is text and image: \n2. Model The models consist of 3 primary types which are Unimodal for Only Text, Unimodal for Only Image, Multimodal for Text and Image. In the Multimodal, I also employed several fusion mechanism such as Concatenation, Multihop Attention, and Stacked Attention. \n2.1 Unimodal for Text BERT and its variant, e.g., RoBERTa, are widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and have demonstrated as efficient methods. In this competition, we employed them for three subtasks. In subtasks A and B, a RoBERTa is used while in subtask C, four RoBERTa models are adopted so that every backbone corresponds classifying the intensity of each emotion.\n2.2 Unimodal for Image As a vision-based approach, EfficientNet-v2 is a well-known backbone with respect to speedy inference and a low number of parameters. In three subtasks, EfficientNet-v2 is used as an extractor to create embeddings. Subtask A has one classification branch to deal with three sentiment types while subtasks B and C have four branches which each is responsible for classifying four types of emotions as well as their intensity.\n2.3 Multimodal Multi-modality is to aggregate vision and text to obtain correlated information. In this challenge, we build three different fusion models including concatenation, multi-hop attention, and stacked attention network.\n2.3.1 Concatenation Traditionally, concatenation of two feature vectors, a.k.a two modalities, has been a typical solution to obtain aggregated features. However, the method does not take into account the importance of each word that is within corresponding regions of the image.\n2.3.2 Multi-hop Attention Multi-hop attention focuses parts of a given image together with texts within it. The technique aims to emphasize dissimilar features between image regions and textual utterances by defining a relevant matrix $R$, which is the cosine distance between textual and visual features.\n2.3.3 Stacked Attention While a multi-hop attention network is used to learn attention maps between an image and texts within it, a stacked attention network has a capability of learning an attention map in multiple times. Through such attention layers, interested regions are promoted through a referred concept within a given sentence.\n3. Techniques In this competition, I have used some techniques to improve the F1 scores of the model.\n3.1 Scence Text Detection Although both textual and visual features are important for meme emotion analysis, there is little correlation between them in the MEMOTION 2.0 dataset. Besides, the caption is also provided as a part of the dataset. Therefore, in this study, the text is removed from the image before extracting and training the proposed model.\nBased on the previous works that summarized both traditional and deep learning approaches for text detection and recognition, we design a preprocessing scheme to remove texts from images as follows. First, we employ the EAST module to detect all text regions in an image. Then these regions are removed from the image, and we use the output image as the input for EfficientNet-v2 in the proposed framework.\nPreprocessing scheme: Given an image as input, we use the EAST detector to detect the region of texts on the image and then remove them 3.2 Auto Augmentation Augmentation is a simple but important technique to increase the size of a given dataset, leading to a better generalization of a training model. However, current data augmentation is based on a set of manually designed algorithms such as Crop, Rotation, and Resize. In our experiment, we adopt the Auto Augment technique which uses reinforcement learning to automatically search for a better data augmentation strategy.\n3.3 Canonical Correlation Analysis The Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is based on a well-established statistical technique that searches for a linear combination of input vectors by maximizing their correlations. Deep CCA tries to utilize the power of both deep neural networks and CCA to overcome projection constraints of CCA . In this study, correlation scores obtained from Deep CCA is included to our loss function to maximize the correlation between two features, leading to a higher classification rate.\n3.4 Loss function, Optimizer, etc For the classification task, I use CrossEntropy typically, but I also tested on Training Signal Anealing CrossEntropy which is a loss function that helps mitigate the imbalance effect of the dataset.  In terms of Optimizer, I tried several ones such as Adam, SGD, AdamW, LookAHead, etc.\n4. Result Some note about this competition: This is not a fair competition because after the private phase, they recruited more teams to submit and manipulated the results several times. This is quite a pity because I didn't notice that all the chair is Indian.... 5. Application Analysis meme images can help social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter mitigate the false information that are disemminating widely. Moreover, the technique in this post can be applied to other Vision Language problems.\n6.

The problem is important in the context of Covid-19 eppidemic so the Vietnamese Groups have established a competition about it. It is took place in VLSP 2021 Workshop, and I got the 3rd position on the private leaderboard of this challenge. Link to the challenge: https://vlsp.org.vn/vlsp2021/eval/vieCap4H\n1. Abstract This study presents our approach on the automatic Vietnamese image captioning for healthcare domains in text processing tasks of Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP) Challenge 2021, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:example}. In recent years, image captioning often employs a convolutional neural network-based architecture as an encoder and a long short-term memory (LSTM) as a decoder to generate sentences. These models perform remarkably well in different datasets. Our proposed model also has an encoder and a decoder, but we instead use a Swin Transformer in the encoder, and a LSTM combined with an attention module in the decoder. The study presents our training experiments and techniques used during the competition. Our model achieves a BLEU4 score of 0.293 in the vietCap4H dataset, and the score is ranked 3$^{rd}$ on the private leaderboard.\nHere is some example of the dataset including an image and its caption\n2. Model Our model as shown here is an end-to-endfusion of a Swin Transformer encoder and bidirec-tional LSTM (biLSTM) decoder. The model takes in an image and outputs the corresponding caption. \n3. Techniques In this competition, I have used some techniques to improve the BLEU4 score, they are listed below: \n3.1 Cross Validation Cross Validation is a well-known technique that helps us choose the best model checkpoint among different folds. In this challenge, we train with 4 folds and choose the one that gives the best score on the leaderboard.\n3.2 Noise Injection In the field of image captioning, the accuracy ofprediction for the next character can be relativelyhigh if we can ensure that the previous sequenceis predicted correctly. However, if a character is mispredicted, then the prediction failure rate will gradually increase. To tackle the above issue, we use noise injection, which is done by randomly replacing ground truth characters with other characters during training, and new sentences will be called fake_labels. Then, using the modified sentences as the input for the decoder will force it to correctly predict the next character on the basis that the previous one was wrong.\n3.3 Beam search The algorithm is a best first search algorithm which iteratively considers the set of the k best sentences up to time (t) as candidates to generate sentences of size(t+ 1), and keep only the resulting bestkof them because this better approximates the probability of getting the global maximum. We tried beam search sizes from 1 to 10, and the best BLEU4 score achieved with a beam size 2.\n4. Result I got the 3rd position on the leaderboard, and some evolution of my attempt is shown here: \n5. Application Solving the problem leads to several practical applications such as virtual assistants for blind and visually impaired people, conducting visual content indexing and searching.\n6.

Lúc đó mình rất thích làm game, có lẽ là vì lúc đó cái mình biết duy nhất là C++, lập trình game nên nghĩ rằng mình sẽ thích làm game developer, và lúc đó mình cũng đã có suy nghĩ rằng bỏ học để làm cho công ty này, nhưng may mắn mình đã suy nghĩ rất kĩ nên quyết định nghỉ làm ở đây và tập trung vào học hành, nhờ vậy mà bây giờ mình đã đỡ hơn xí :rofl:. Mình được tham gia vào một nhóm làm về game Dragon City (nếu nhớ không nhầm), trong team mình ấn tượng nhất là một nhóc nhỏ hơn mình 2 tuổi, nó rớt đại học nhưng biết code từ khá lâu nên nó xin vào chính thức ở cty luôn, nhưng nó cũng tâm sự là xin chuyển việc khá khó cho nó vì nó không có bằng đại học, mặc dù kĩ năng code cũng tốt, biết nhiều framework, chịu được áp lực. Trong team cũng có một ông anh làm 2,3 năm nhưng thấy chán và quyết định về quê bán trái cây. Những trường hợp này làm mình suy nghĩ khá nhiều về tương lai :thinking: Điều mình học được ở cty này là cách làm việc nhóm, học được thêm một framework làm game (cocos2d-x) và những kinh nghiệm làm game của các đàn anh trong cty. Thế nhưng khi vào chính thức thì công việc khá chán đó là ngồi fix bug cho game từ công ty mẹ gửi về :expressionless: (cái này tùy ng cảm nhận chứ mình không phải đi chê cty đâu). Đặc biệt là chuyến đi teambuilding ở Đà Lạt cực kì tuyệt vời, lần đầu tiên ở khách sạn 5*, và mình được trải qua hai đêm vô cùng tuyệt vời với các anh em :satisfied:.\n2. Năm 3 đến gần cuối năm 4 Công việc thứ 2 mình có được là ở mot công ty Nhật. Mình có được công việc này là do một lần a Leader trong cty có nhờ thầy của mình giới thiệu sinh viên, và mình đã ứng tuyển công việc này ở vị trí AI Intern (mặc dù làm như nhân viên chính thức :joy:. Ở cty này, mình đã có cơ hội làm về AI/Computer Vision, và có 2 dự án lớn mà mình đã tham gia đó là OCR trên tiếng nhật và Face Recognition mặc dù lúc đó vẫn còn rất non tay trong việc tuning, modifiy model nhưng những dự án đó là tiếp thêm cho mình đam mê để tiếp tục con đường AI của mình. Khi làm việc ở cty này, mình rất may mắn vì được a Leader ưu ái tìm hiểu rất nhiều thứ và đặc biệt là cho làm luận văn của mình và cung cấp laptop để training model. Tuy nhiên, ở giữa năm 4, mình đã phải xin nghỉ để tập trung vào luận văn vì với mình luận văn thực sự quan trọng và mình còn đặt mục tiêu ra được paper nên mình phải xin nghỉ để tập trung vào việc này. Ngoài ra, Gumi thật sự ko phải là một cty làm chính về AI nên máy móc rất hạn chế, nhân lực về AI còn non nớt, nên đó cũng là một phần nguyên do mình xin nghỉ. Ở cty này mình được tự học nhiều thứ, cũng vì do team AI chỉ bao gồm những bạn trẻ, chưa co kinh nghiệm nhiều nên mỗi người phải tự đào bới kiến thức. Tuy nhiên, cty này của nhật nên cách làm việc cũng khá cứng nhắc, anyway, do tui k thích phong cách làm việc này thôi, khá khó để nói chuyện với cấp trên để trình bày ý kiến.\n3. Nam 4 + 1 nam sau DH Mình được thầy mình giới thiệu vào cty này, lúc đó chỉ có 2,3 bạn là được thầy \u0026quot;gửi gắm\u0026quot; để có thể vào đó hoàn thành luận văn.Và thật sự cty này ban đầu làm mình choáng ngợp bởi máy móc vô cùng tối tân, nhân viên thì cực kì giỏi và đặc biệt là nó gần nhà mình :joy:.  Tuy nhiên, mình đã quá nóng vội khi xin vào vị trí nhân viên chính thức chứ ko phải intern như các bạn khác, việc này làm cho mình rất áp lực vì mình phải làm luận văn và chạy dự án cty cùng một lúc, và kết quả thì ko nói cũng biết, mình chỉ có thể hoàn thành được luận văn mà k đảm bảo được nghiên cứu cho cty. Nhưng may mắn là mình vẫn được đẩy qua team product để làm sau đó, lúc này mình thoải mái hơn vì đã xong luận văn, và lúc này mình được làm với một team product rất giỏi, mặc dù ko phải làm research nhưng team này có những ý tưởng rất hay, code cũng rất tốt nên mình đã học được rất nhiều. Hình thức của cty là startup nên cũng có nhiều lần phải thức qua đêm để chạy dự án, đây là những kỉ niệm đầu đời có lẽ mình ko thể quên được với các đồng nghiệp của mình. Tuy nhiên, vì một vài lí do, mình cũng phải rời cty, phần lớn là do mình cảm thấy con đường của mình ko phù hợp với định hướng của cty vì thế mình quyết định rời đi và đến với 1 cong ty khac.\n4. Truoc khi roi khoi VN Dây là một môi trường lí tưởng, các anh chị ở đây cực kì nice và professional. Và ở cty này mình cũng được làm điều mình thích đó là Robotics Vision, tuy nhiên cty k tập trung làm AI mà là về web,apps và phần cứng của Robot nên mình cảm thấy khó để tiến bộ, team AI lúc đó cũng chỉ có 2 ng và một người thì từ BlockChain qua, cũng chưa có nhiều kinh nghiệm về AI. Lúc này mình mới quyết định đi làm nghiên cứu để có thể hoàn toàn làm thứ mình thích, vì thế mình chọn du học HQ.\n5. Du học HQ Khi paper đầu tiên của mình đc accept cùng với việc mình đã có ielts, thầy mình đã giói thiệu luôn học bổng giáo sư hàn quốc cho mình. Lúc đó cũng khá băn khoăn do đang dịch và mình cũng đang muốn đi châu âu hơn (cụ thể là Phần Lan), tuy nhiên thầy cũng động viên và mình cũng ham hố đi nên thôi nhắm mắt chọn luôn :joy:. Khi qua đây thì mình đc vào một lab có điều kiện cũng khá tốt, giáo cũng khá nice, tuy nhiên thì cũng có một vài điều không thích thì đó là do cách cảm nhận của mỗi người khi làm việc ở lab thôi, bản thân mình cảm thấy chưa có gì là quá đáng. Tuy nhiên, điều mình cảm thấy thiếu ở lab hiện tại là các member trong lab mỗi người làm một việc khác nhau nên cũng khó có thể trao đổi, hơn nữa, cá nhân mình thích các cuôc thi để nâng cao khả năng nhưng trong lab ko ai thích thú cả, có người thì chỉ đăng kí xong, rồi download data, xong rồi để đó cũng chẳng làm gì, vì vậy mình hiện tại vẫn đang alone (cô độc) trong lab =)))))))\n6. Future Trong tương lai, có thể mình sẽ ko hoàn thành chương trình Tiến sĩ mà sẽ xin xuống Thạc sĩ và về nước xin việc, hoặc mình sẽ hoàn thành luôn Tiến sĩ và xin Postdoc ở một nước khác hoặc có thể về nước xin việc =))), 2 đất nước mà mình thích nhất bây giờ có lẽ là nước Anh (và trường mà mình thích nhất ở Anh là Imperial College London) và Thụy Điển (trường mình thích nhất là Royal KTH), anyway, đó là một câu chuyện khá xa, bây giờ mình chỉ muốn ra đc một, hai paper thôi, thể là đủ để tốt nghiệp, kakaka.\n(Tín Nguyễn)  ","link":"fingerstin.org/post/personal/career/","section":"post","tags":["personal"],"title":"My Career"},{"body":"Hi, xin chào các bạn, hôm này mình sẽ giới thiệu cho các bạn bài toán Multiple Object Tracking sử dụng Kalman Filter để theo vết đối tượng và thuật toán Hungary để giải bài toán credit assignment, nói nôm na là làm sao gán từng tracker vào mỗi object sao cho chi phí là ít nhất. Ngoài ra, ở bài này, mình chỉ sử dụng phương pháp trừ nền (Background Subtraction) để detect đối tượng động. Các bạn có thể thay thế bằng các thuật toán object detection khác như YOLO, Faster RCNN, Centernet, etc. Link code: Đây là code của thuật toán, đã được mình implement bằng C++, đây cũng là đồ án môn Computer Vision của mình hồi năm 3 tại trường đại học khoa học tự nhiên, Hồ Chí Minh. Code\nNội dung chính sẽ bao gồm các phần sau: 1. Giới thiệu bài toàn Multiple Object Tracking  2. Nguyên lý  3. Phương pháp \n 3.1 Background Generation 3.2 Object Detection  3.3 Kalman Filter  3.4 Hungary Algorithm   4. Ứng dụng  5. Tham khảo \n1. Giới thiệu bài toán Multiple Object Tracking  Đây đơn giản là bài toán theo vết nhiều đối tượng cùng một lúc. 2. Nguyên lý  Nguyên lí của bài toán này vẫn là tìm kiếm nhiều đối tượng (object detection) và so khớp (matching) đối tượng với những đối tượng ở frame trước để xác định đâu là những đối tượng cần theo vết. 3. Phương pháp  Ở frame đầu tiên, ta sẽ dùng phương pháp trừ nền để phát hiện đối tượng và cũng sẽ được dùng ở những frame sau với mục đích detect đối tượng động. Sau đó, ta sẽ dùng Kalman Filter (KF) để dự đoán vị trí tiếp theo của từng đối tượng.\nĐể có thể dự đoán được vị trí bằng KF chính xác, ta phải thực hiện so khớp (matching). Ở bước này, ta phải xác định được đối tượng nào là đối tượng nào ở frame trước đó, và ta sẽ giải quyết bằng thuật toán Hungary Algorithm.\nCuối cùng là lặp lại quá trình trên đến khi video kết thúc.\n  3.1 Background Generation Để sử dụng phương pháp trừ nền, yêu cầu là background của chúng ta phải khá tĩnh, nếu background động thì phương pháp không còn tác dụng vì phương pháp này mục đích là để trích xuất được những đối tượng động.  Để trừ nền, ta đơn giản chỉ cần dùng background ở frame (t) - background ở frame (t-1). Tuy nhiên, mình đã thử và thấy có một phương pháp khác hay hơn, đó là Pixel Histrogram. Pixel Histogram là phương pháp tái tạo nền, input sẽ là một histogram, output là nền được tái tạo dưới dạng grayscale. Giả sử mỗi kích thước của một frame là w (width) và h (height). Ứng với mỗi pixel trên frame, ta sẽ có một histogram 256 chiều. Sau khi có được tất cả là (w x h) histogram, ta sẽ lấy ra giá trị màu lớn nhất ở mỗi histogram và đặt làm giá trị màu tại pixel tương ứng. Cuối cùng sẽ tái tạo được background. Để tạo ra được từng histogram đó, ta cần phải lướt qua K frame của video, ứng với mỗi frame ta sẽ lướt từng pixel, lấy ra giá trị màu ở pixel đó và cuối cùng là tăng thêm 1 cho bin màu tương ứng của histogram. Sau khi lướt hết K frame, ta sẽ có được (w x h) histogram.\n  3.2 Object Detection Sau khi có được nền, ta sẽ bước đến giai đoạn detection \u0026amp; tracking. Để detect những đối tượng động, mỗi lần process frame, ta sẽ lấy frame đó trừ cho nền đã được tái tạo bằng phương pháp ở trên. Phương pháp này rất đơn giản, nếu 2 đối tượng đi gần nhau quá sẽ bị dính và cho là 1 đối tượng nhưng được cái là nó cực kì nhanh =)) Đây là phương pháp đơn giản, vì hồi đó mới sinh viên, có biết deep learning đâu nên làm cách này haha. Bây giờ các bạn có thể dùng YOLO hoặc Faster RCNN, CenterNet để detect cho chính xác hơn.\n    3.3 Kalman Filter Kalman Filter là một mô hình lọc nhiễu, nó bao gồm 2 phần đó là dự đoán (predict) và cập nhật (update). Ở bước predict, nó sẽ dự đoán vị trí của từng đối tượng, sau đó ở bước Update nó sẽ cập nhật, sửa lại cho đúng hơn.\n  3.4 Hungary Algorithm Đây là thuật toán dùng để giải quyết assignment problem. Assignment Problem là bài toán có N đối tượng, và M công việc, mỗi đối tượng khi làm một công việc nào đó sẽ có một chi phí nhất định. Và nhiệm vụ đó là làm sao gán mỗi đối tượng cho một công việc nào đó sao cho tổng chi phí là nhỏ nhất. \n  Đối với bài toán tracking, ta có thể áp dụng như sau: Ta có N tracker và M đối tượng detect được, và ta phải gán từng tracker với từng đối tượng sao cho chi phí là nhỏ nhất. Vậy chi phí ở đây là gì ? Mỗi tracker đó chính là một Kalman Filter (KF), ở mỗi frame, KF sẽ dự đoán vị trí của đối tượng trước, gọi là p_predict, và ở mỗi frame ta lại detect đối tượng và ra được vị trí của chúng gọi là p_object. Vậy, khỏang cách giữa p_predict và p_object chính là chi phí. Ta sẽ đưa thông tin này qua thuật toán Hungary để giải quyết bài toán assignment, và KF sẽ cập nhật lại vị trí tracking của mình. 5. Ứng dụng và Bàn luận  Bài toán này được ứng dụng trong theo vết đối tượng giao thông, đối tượng trong các siêu thị, cửa hàng, ... Ở bài viết này, mình chỉ viết trình bày đơn giản các bước, chưa trình bày kĩ thuật toán cũng như có code minh họa vì mình không có thời gian nhiều để làm kĩ, mong các bạn thông cảm.

Although Navigation can be tackled by using Supervised Learning, but using Reinforcement Learning help us learn without any human-labeled data.\nLink paper: Paper Link code: Code\nThe content is as following: 1. Introduction to Instruction Navigation  2. Principle  3. Methodology \n 3.1 Image Representation Module  3.2 Text Representation Module  3.3 Attented Representation Module  3.4 Policy Learning   4. Application  5. Reference \n1. Introduction to Instruction Navigation  Navigation problem is a familiar topic and it has been carried out many experiments in so many years. The problem is to make an agent move in an environment and achieve a predefined target. In general, this problem can be solved by Reinforcement Learning, the agent will receive an observation which contains several information such as image, depth, segmentation or sensor information, etc. Howerver, human want to make command for the agent through instruction, so the agent now has an additional information which is a text, or voice. The low-level instruction will be simple commands such as go straight, go left, go right, etc, but in practice, the instruction is more complex, it needs to consider other elements such as size, color, etc of the objects nearby. And that is the motivation of the Instruction Navigation problem. 2. Principle  The principle of Vision-Language problems is how to fuse multiple features together.  And with this problem, it composes of 3 components, (1) is to get image features, (2) is to get textual features, (3) is how to fuse these features together which is the most important part. In this paper, the fusion strategy they've used is concatenation and Hadarmard (element-wise) product. The final stage is the decision-making part, which employs a policy learning algorithm to make decision. A well-known but simple algorithm used in this situation is Asynchronous Actor Critic (A3C). 3. Methodology  The methodology simply takes an image and an instruction as inputs. Noted that, with each episode, there is only one instruction, but the image changes continually.   3.1 Image Representation Module In order to extract visual features, they employed a simple 3-layer CNN.\n  3.2 Text Representation Module In terms of extracting textual features, first, they employed Word Embedding on the text input, then converted it to sentence embedding by using LSTM or GRU.\n  3.3 Attented Representation Module\n  After getting a hold of 2 feature vectors, they use Hadardmard (element-wise) product to fuse the features together, and this is called Gated Attention.  3.4 Policy Learning  The policy learning will help the agent make decision which direction is going on. In this paper, the author use A3C, which is a well-known but simple reinforcement learning algorithm. 5. Application  This algorithm can be applied to robotics, however, this stll have some limits such as only handling short, and simple instructions. 6.

Nói sơ qua một chút, mình may mắn nhận được học bổng giáo sư tại HQ vào tháng 9/2020 tại trường đại học Sejong ngành Computer Science and Engineering nhờ vào sự giới thiệu của giáo sư ở trường đại học của mình. Và cũng may mắn khi giáo sư trao mình học bổng có hướng nghiên cứu mà mình ưa thích đó là Computer Vision in Robotics, Drone.\nP/s: Lúc đầu mình cũng ko muốn đi qua Hàn vì khá nhiều lí do, một là đang trong mùa dịch, mình cũng chả muốn đi đâu vì sợ bị dính covid, hai là cảm thấy bản thân chưa đủ tốt để đi học tiếp lên, ba là mình ko biết tiếng Hàn, nhưng giáo sư ở VN của mình đã động viên và cũng thấy nhiều a/c đã sang Hàn và thành công nên mình quyết định thử sức. Sau 2 năm, mình cảm thấy đây là một quyết định bước ngoặt của mình, vì mình học được rất nhiều thứ, kể cả kiến thức lẫn kĩ năng sống ở một đất nước xa lạ.\n!(Sejong Computer Science Department)(/images/scholarship/sejong.jpg)\n1. Apply học bổng Việc apply học bổng giáo sư đơn giản hơn các loại học bổng khác, đương nhiên là nếu hồ sơ của bạn càng tốt thì khả năng bạn được nhận càng cao. Tại thời điểm mình xin học bổng, hồ sơ của mình cũng không thuộc dạng quá khủng, mình chỉ có 1 paper nộp ở một tạp chí quốc tế bình thường, tiếng anh thì có bằng ielts 6.0, 1 CV, bảng điểm thuộc dạng khá và một kế hoạch học tập (study plan). Ngoài ra, nếu bạn có thêm thành tích, chứng chỉ gì thì nộp thêm cũng được, miễn là thấy nó phù hợp.\nKhi có đủ giấy tờ trên, bạn cần liên lạc với giáo sư sớm để nộp hồ sơ, nếu gs chấp nhận thì sẽ phỏng vấn để hỏi về thành tích của bạn, nếu gs đồng ý cho bạn học bổng thì 99% là bạn đi sang hq được rồi đấy, 1% còn lại là làm các thủ tục cần thiết để trường xét và xin visa.\n2. Chuẩn bị giấy tờ nộp cho trường Về phần này thì tùy từng trường yêu cầu, bạn nên lên trang web của trường để tìm hiểu hoặc liên lạc với phòng quan hệ quốc tế của trường đó để hỏi cho chắc. May mắn trường mình xin vào có cộng đồng người Việt khá nhiều nên mình cũng được họ giúp đỡ giấy tờ lẫn xin ở kí túc xá ở trường. Mình cảm thấy khá may mắn vì mình không biết tiếng hàn và cũng đi trong mùa dịch nên có rất nhiều khó khăn trong giao tiếp và nơi ở trong thời gian đầu qua Hàn.\n3. Chờ giấy mời nhập học, đóng tiền và xin visa Sau khi xong 2 bước trên, thì bạn phải chờ 1,2 tháng để trường ra danh sách sinh viên đậu vào trường, sau đó là đóng tiền và chờ giấy báo nhập học gửi về, cuối cùng là khám sức khỏe và xin visa.\n3. Xin Visa Khi xin visa, bạn nên liên hệ với trung tâm đăng kí visa hàn quốc (Korea Visa Application Center) để hỏi các giấy tờ cần thiết thay vì chỉ nghe một chiều từ phòng quan hệ quốc tế của trường mà bạn du học, tránh trường hợp phải làm đi làm lại giấy tờ. Trong trường hợp của mình, mình đã phải mất tận 5 lần mới hoàn thành được hồ sơ xin visa, lần 1 thì thiếu giấy bảo lãnh, giấy số dư tài khoản và giấy chứng nhận RA (Research Assistant), lần 2 thì sai form giấy bảo lãnh của trung tâm visa, thiếu giấy chứng nhận con dấu của giáo sư (cái này giáo sư phải ra cơ quan địa phương xin), lần 3 thì do con dấu trong giấy bảo lãnh không khớp với giấy chưng nhận con dấu (do 1 giáo sư có thể có nhiều con dấu), lần 4 thì bên trung tâm visa không chấp nhận giấy Chứng nhận RA và giấy bảo lãnh vì thời điểm mà giáo sư kí 2 giấy đó quá 3 tháng gần nhất, thế là mình phải nhờ gs gửi lại 2 bản mới với thời điểm được cập nhật, và tới lần 5 thì mới oke.  P/s: Cá nhân mình thấy trung tâm Visa làm việc khá thiếu chuyên nghiệp, những thông tin này ko hề được ghi trên web, nhân viên thì ko nói rõ ràng để tránh việc xin đi xin lại. Và riêng đối với mình, cay nhất là ở lần xin visa thứ 3, bên KVAC có bảo mình bổ sung một loại giấy tờ thể hiện thông tin của gs và mình, nhưng tới lần 4 lên nộp thì trung tâm lại bảo không cần giấy đó nữa. Vì vậy, các bạn nên hỏi thật kĩ trung tâm nhé.\nTrên đây là những kinh nghiệm đút kết của mình, bạn nào có ý định sang Hàn hãy tìm hiểu kỹ nhé.

Read more about usePageBundles.\nWith page bundles, resources for a page or section, like images or attached files, live in the same directory as the content itself rather than in your static directory.\nHugo Clarity supports the use of leaf bundles, which are any directories within the content directory that contain an index.md file. Hugo's documentation gives this example:\n1content 2├── about 3│ ├── index.md 4├── posts 5│ ├── my-post 6│ │ ├── content1.md 7│ │ ├── content2.md 8│ │ ├── image1.jpg 9│ │ ├── image2.png 10│ │ └── index.md 11│ └── my-other-post 12│ └── index.md 13│ 14└── another-section 15├── .. 16└── not-a-leaf-bundle 17├── .. 18└── another-leaf-bundle 19└── index.md  In the above example `content` directory, there are four leaf bundles: about: This leaf bundle is at the root level (directly under content directory) and has only the index.md.\nmy-post: This leaf bundle has the index.md, two other content Markdown files and two image files. image1 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources. image2 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources.\nmy-other-post: This leaf bundle has only the index.md.\nanother-leaf-bundle: This leaf bundle is nested under couple of directories. This bundle also has only the index.md.\nThe hierarchy depth at which a leaf bundle is created does not matter, as long as it is not inside another leaf bundle.\n Advantages to using page bundles The image below is part of the bundle of this page, and is located at content/post/bundle/building.png. Because it's within this page's bundle, the markup for the image only has to specify the image's filename, building.png.\n    If you ever change the name of the directory in which this Markdown file and the image reside, the reference to the image would not need to be updated.\nIn addition to more cleanly organizing your content and related assets, when using page bundles, Hugo Clarity will automatically generate markup for modern image formats, which are smaller in file size.\nFor instance, when you reference an image like building.png, Hugo Clarity will check to see if the same image (based on filename) exists in WebP, AVIF or JXL formats. If you inspect the image above, you'll see a \u0026lt;source\u0026gt; element for building.webp, because that file is also present. Hugo Clarity will only include the markup if these images exist.\nBrowsers that support these formats and the \u0026lt;picture\u0026gt; element will load them, while browsers that do not will fall-back to the default image. Read more about this process.\nFinally, note that page assets can be further managed and refined within the page's front matter if you wish, and are not limited to images alone.\nDisadvantages to using page bundles Page resources in a bundle are only available to the page with which they are bundled — that means you can't include an image with one page and then reference it from another.\nImages that are being used in multiple places are more appropriate for your Hugo assets directory. Unlike files in the Hugo static directory, files in the assets directory can be run through Hugo Pipes, which includes image processing.\n  The above quote is excerpted from Rob Pike's talk during Gopherfest, November 18, 2015.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","link":"fingerstin.org/post/hugo_guidance/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Hugo Usage"},{"body":"","link":"fingerstin.org/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"}]
