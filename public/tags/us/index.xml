            General Questions You Will be Asked: Tip: Ask early on: What the interviewing faculty is working on? (this gives an idea of what he/she sees as a possible alignment to your own research work).
Read up on their recent work and ask relevant questions or pose possible extensions. Ask good questions.
 Tell us about yourself. Why’d you apply here? Or What drew you to this program?   Research fit, what is that they are doing that excites you?
